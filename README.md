# AI-ML-Internship
#Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a dataset
**Objective:**
Learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset to understand data trends and distributions.
**Dataset:**
Iris Dataset

Here is the 1st task of AI/ML internship in which i learn how to load and inspect using pandas library.
it also include descriptive statictics and data exploration using .info() and .describe() method
i learn in my first task how to visualize dataset by creating:
scatter plot(to show relation ship between features), 
histogram(to show value distribution),
box plot(to identify outliers) through matplotlip and seaborn library.
